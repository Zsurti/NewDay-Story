And i know that i am truly blessed! and i will never forget to seek help from ALLAH in any situation in my life. 

And here i come at the second last stage of the Git chapter. and i am happy that i am able  to understand and working on it easily. Alhamdollilah. 




I feel really blessed that ALLAH always support me though i failed to obey his agreements many times. I am sorry ALLAH but i will change myself and my behavior for the good sake.
